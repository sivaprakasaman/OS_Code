  <h1>Setting Up Freenas with SSH Keys</h1>

  <div class="entry">
    <p>Recently I have been playing around with how to remotely log into
 my NAS. For a while I have had it so that I have to pass my password 
into my terminal to login. However, this limits my ability to script my 
computer to do things that would send data back and forth without me 
interfering. Well, that just wouldn’t do so I set out to find a way 
around this.</p>

<p>To preface this, I am not going over how to setup a Freenas server or anything else. This is for post setup.</p>

<h3 id="the-problem">The Problem</h3>
<p>The problem is that Freenas (9.2 at least since that is what I am 
using) does not properly set permissions for user accounts when it is 
creating them, which causes a conflict when setting up SSH Key 
authentication. Try as you may, you probably will run into a <code class="highlighter-rouge">private key error</code> of some sort.</p>

<p>I had to do a ton of searching on Google to find that one random thread with the fix, but I found it!</p>

<h3 id="the-solution">The Solution</h3>
<p>Freenas should be as simple as:</p>

<ol>
  <li>On your computer, run <code class="highlighter-rouge">ssh-keygen</code> and create a key.</li>
  <li>Navigate to your <code class="highlighter-rouge">~/.ssh/</code> folder and find your <code class="highlighter-rouge">id_rsa.pub</code> file. Copy the contents</li>
  <li>Select the user you want in your Freenas user list, and paste the 
contents of the prior file in the area that says “SSH Public Key”.</li>
  <li>Hit save.</li>
</ol>

<p>HOWEVER, hitting save may not work because I found I still had an issue. After I hit save I had to do the following steps:</p>

<ol>
  <li>Log into your Freenas WebGUI and open up the shell.</li>
  <li><code class="highlighter-rouge">chmod 755 /mnt</code> and then hit enter</li>
  <li><code class="highlighter-rouge">chmod 755/mnt/media</code> &lt;- Where media is probably your data set (mine is called <code class="highlighter-rouge">Data</code>). Again hitting enter.</li>
  <li><code class="highlighter-rouge">chown yourUsername /mnt/mount/yourUserFolder</code> &lt;- This tells the system that your user owns the folder.</li>
  <li><code class="highlighter-rouge">chmod 700 /mnt/mount/yourUserFolder</code> &lt;- Secures your home directory</li>
  <li>Close the shell and head over to your other computer that has your <code class="highlighter-rouge">id_rsa</code> on it. SSH into your NAS <code class="highlighter-rouge">ssh yourUsername@FreeNasIP</code>.
 You will be asked for your password. If you aren’t, and it fails, go to
 the SSH settings on your NAS and set it to ask for passwords.</li>
  <li>Now that you are in, create a <code class="highlighter-rouge">~/.ssh</code> directory. Do this by running <code class="highlighter-rouge">mkdir .ssh</code> when you log in with your user.</li>
  <li>Finally we want to upload your public key. Type <code class="highlighter-rouge">exit</code> so you disconnect, and then navigate to your local <code class="highlighter-rouge">~/.ssh</code> folder. Run the following command (with proper parameters) so that we upload your <code class="highlighter-rouge">id_rsa.pub</code>:</li>
</ol>

<div class="language-bash highlighter-rouge"><pre class="highlight"><code>cat id_rsa.pub | ssh yourUsername@FreeNasIP <span class="s1">'cat &gt;&gt; ~/.ssh/authorized_keys'</span>
ssh yourUsername@FreeNasIP <span class="s1">'chmod -R 700 ~/.ssh'</span> 
</code></pre>
</div>

<ol>
  <li>Now you should be good to log into your server without being asked for a password. Simply type <code class="highlighter-rouge">ssh yourUsername@FreeNasIP</code> and you will connect.</li>
</ol>

<p>This bug seems really agrivating, and honestly it took me way too 
long to figure out what it was and how to fix it. For reference, this 
answer is <a href="https://forums.freenas.org/index.php?threads/passwordless-ssh-cannot-get-it-to-work-what-so-ever-please-help.542/">from this forum post</a>.</p>

<p>Hopefully this helps some of you out there. Up next, how to automate your Plex uploads!</p>
